🏠 House Prices Prediction
📘 Overview

This project aims to predict the sale prices of residential homes using advanced regression techniques. The analysis includes data exploration, feature engineering, and model development to achieve accurate predictions based on housing attributes.

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle — House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

Files Used:

train.csv — Training dataset with features and target variable (SalePrice)

test.csv — Test dataset for predictions

The dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

🔍 Project Workflow

Data Loading & Exploration

Imported and examined the training and test datasets

Analyzed missing values, outliers, and feature distributions

Feature Engineering

Handled missing values using imputation strategies

Transformed skewed numerical features

Encoded categorical features (label encoding / one-hot encoding)

Created new features where beneficial

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature relationships with SalePrice

Checked correlations between numerical variables

Identified and treated influential outliers

Modeling

Implemented and evaluated various regression algorithms such as:

Linear Regression

Ridge / Lasso Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost — if applicable)

Used cross-validation for model selection and performance evaluation

Prediction & Submission

Generated predictions for the test set

Prepared a submission file for Kaggle

📈 Evaluation

Models were evaluated primarily using:

Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) — the Kaggle competition metric

Cross-validation scores to assess model generalization
